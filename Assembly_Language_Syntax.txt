----------------Assembly Language----------------

commands/ Operation Function- represented by opcodes - for example ADD, SUB, MOV

ADD AX, BX  ; means AX= AX + BX -> AX is the destination and BX is the source
ADD CX, 1   ; means CX = CX + 1 -> CX is the destination  and 1 is literal

-------------
SUB CX, 4 ; CX = CX - 4

-----------------
MOV is an opcode represents data movements.

MOV AX,4 ; means AX = 4

----------------
INC AX  ; AX = AX + 1

-----------------------------
Data/Variables/Inputs can be numeric or character types.

Numeric data can be either binary, decimal or hexadecimal.

-> MOV AX, 1010  ; This is ilegal. Because we can not tell whether it is binary, decimal or hexadecimal. This is why we must append either B, D, H to represent the number system the number belongs.
If no letter is appended at the end of a number it will be considered a decimal number.

MOV AX, 1010H
MOV AX, 1000B
MOV AX, 1010D ; decimal number.

-> Characters: 
Character strings must be enclosed with single or double quotes.
 e.g. ‘A’ or “hello” is translated into ASCII by assembler. So, there is no difference between ‘A’ or 41h or 65d.
 
 ----Check ASCII Character Set---

==> 143B is not legal as Binary consists of 1 or 0.



=======================Variable==========================
It is difficult to remember memory address length, so we named it as variable
-> VARIABLE is to store values temporarily. Each variable has data types (DB. DW)
DB- define byte (1 byte)
DW- define word (2 byte)

Byte Variables (1 byte = 8 bit)
=> variable name type initial value
MYNUMBER DB 7 ; means in C-> byte MYNUMBER = 7;

ASSUME YOU HAVE A VARIABLE DECLARATION WITHOUT ANY INITIAL value-
 MYNUMBER DB ?

=> The range of values in a byte is 2^8 or 256.

---------------Word Variables
=> variable name type initial value
MYNUMBER DW -2

The range is 2^16 or 65536.
